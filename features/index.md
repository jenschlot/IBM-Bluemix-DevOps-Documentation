### Build and deploy your way
Configure your project to automatically deploy to [IBM Bluemix](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/) whenever a project member pushes code to your Git repository or Jazz SCM. You can simply deploy files as they are pushed, or you can configure more advanced build options to be deployed automatically.

To learn more about configuring and using the various build and deploy capabilities, see the tutorial [Getting Started with Bluemix and DevOps Services using Node.js](/tutorials/jazzeditor) or [Getting Started with Bluemix and DevOps Services using Java](/tutorials/jazzeditorjava).

### Git hosting
It's simple to track, plan, and develop your project, and you don't have to give up your favorite SCM. You can quickly create a project with a Git repository to share your source with team members (private projects), or the world. Edit your source, push commits, and automatically deploy changes to the cloud, all without leaving your browser. And, don't worry, your favorite Git client is supported too.

### Connect with your GitHub repository
It's easy to link work items with GitHub code changes: use your existing tools to code,	 and manage your project with DevOps Services. You can reference a work item in the GitHub comments before you push code changes, and the	 work item is updated with the new commit.

### Your work in one place
It's My Stuff. Get a quick view of the projects you own, belong	 to, and like. See project invitations and requests too. Just	 another way to help you stay organized.

### Built-in source code management
Easy code delivery and seamless tracking of changes from all developers. Each project gets a Git repository or a Jazz source code management repository and workspace where project members check in changes, associate code changes with work items, and view a history of recent updates.

### Work items to track and plan project activities
Track who's doing what, and when it will get done. Need a design? Open a task and assign it	 to the person with the wireframing tools. Something not working? Then, open a defect. Hidden benefit: expect a warm fuzzy when you complete a work item, and the status changes to Done.

### Dashboard charts for project status
Choose from over 50 widgets to customize your dashboard! Use a burndown chart for	 tracking team velocity and work-item and source-control widgets to track individual work.
