## Easy to find What's New

## Git hosting

It's simple to track, plan, and develop your project, and you don't have to 
give up your favorite SCM.  You can quickly create a project with a 
Git repository to share your source with team members (private 
projects), or with the world.  Edit your source, push commits, and 
automatically deploy changes to	the cloud, all without leaving your
browser. And, don't worry, your favorite Git client is supported too.

## Connect with your GitHub repository
			
It's easy to link work items with GitHub code changes: use your existing 
tools to code, and manage your project with  DevOps Services.  You 
can reference a work item in the GitHub comments before you push 
code changes, and the work item is updated with the new commit information.

## Your work in one place

Get a quick view of the projects you own, belong to, and
 like. See project invitations and requests too. Just another way 
to help you stay organized.

## Simple user interface for starting a project quickly

Easily add the "who, what, and when" of your development project. It only takes a few minutes to set dates, document your first user story, assign a task or two, and dive in to the code.

##Bluemix Live Sync

With node.js apps, you can make changes to static files, like HTML or CSS, and have them immediately included in the deployed app by using the IBM® Bluemix™ Live Sync feature. Refresh the app in your browser to see the changes. You can also edit code, and use the **Quick Restart** icon restart the Node run time in a matter of seconds, without redeploying the app. You can use the Debugger to create breakpoints and inspect variables in your code so you can isolate problem areas as you work.

For more information about Bluemix Live Sync, [see the documentation for IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade;](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#manageapps/bluemixlive.html#bluemixlive).


<a name='scm'></a>
## Built-in source code management						

Easily deliver code and seamless track changes from all developers. 
Each project gets a Git repository or a Jazz source code management
 repository and workspace where project members check in changes, 
associate code changes with work items, and view a history of recent 
updates.

## Build and deploy your way

Configure your project to automatically deploy whenever a project member pushes code to your Git repository or Jazz&trade;  Source Code Management (SCM) repository to [Bluemix](//bluemix.net/ "Bluemix"). You can simply deploy files as they are pushed, or you
can configure more advanced build options to be deployed automatically.

To learn more about configuring and using the various build and deploy capabilities,
see these resources:

## Work items to track and plan project activities						

Track who's doing what, and when it will get done. Need a design? Open a task
 and assign it to the person with the wireframing tools. Something 
not working? Then, open a defect.  Hidden benefit: expect a warm 
fuzzy when you complete a work item and change the status to Done.

<a name='dashboard'></a>
## Dashboard charts for project status										

Choose from over 50 widgets to customize your dashboard! Use a burndown chart 
for tracking team velocity and work-item and source-control widgets
 to track individual work.
