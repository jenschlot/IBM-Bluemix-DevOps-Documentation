##Learning objectives

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
* Create a sample IBM Bluemix app
* View the preconfigured Bluemix DevOps Services pipeline that deploys your app to Bluemix 
* Make a quick change to your app in the DevOps Services Web IDE
* View your updated app on the web

##Before you begin

To complete this tutorial, you need an [IBM id][30] that is registered with DevOps Services. Also, be sure to [register for Bluemix][32].

##Deploy a sample app

**This section needs to be retooled for the new sample Node.js app (under construction). Sentiment Analysis requires messing with Twitter API keys and is therefore not delightful.**

You start with the sample project, [Sentiment Analysis App][2]. This Node.js app uses a Git repository, and includes a Grunt build file.

Before you start, [explore the live version of the sample project][27]. The app analyzes Twitter users' collective sentiment about a search phrase. 

After you explore the project, click the button below to create your own copy of it by forking and deploying it:

After the project is forked and the deployment completes, click **EDIT CODE** to continue.
