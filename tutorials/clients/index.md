#Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects

Last modified: 14 November 2014

In IBM&reg; DevOps Services, you decide how you code.  You can work in the cloud by using the web IDE or you can work in a desktop client.

To work in a desktop client, you must configure it for your repository.

1. From [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net), go to the project overview page.

2. On the right side of the page, locate the source control configuration link.
 * <a name='git'></a>If you see the **Git URL** link, you are using a Git repository. See [Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects and Git source control][1].
 * <a name='jazzscm'></a>If you see the **Configure eclipse client** link, you are using Jazz source control management.  See [Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects and Jazz source control][2].
