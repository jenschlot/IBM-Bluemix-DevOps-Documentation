#Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects
---
In IBM&reg; DevOps Services, you decide how you code.  You can work in the cloud by using the web IDE or you can work in a desktop client.

To work in a desktop client, you must configure the client for your repository. From [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net), go to the project overview page. On the right side of the page, if you see the **Configure eclipse client** link, you are using [Jazz source control management](#jazzscm). If you see the **Git URL** link, you are using a [Git repository](#git).
