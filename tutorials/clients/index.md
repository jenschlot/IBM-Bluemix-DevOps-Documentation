#Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects
---
IBM&reg; DevOps Services, you decide how you code.  You can work in the cloud by using the web IDE or you can work in a desktop client.

To work in a desktop client, you must configure the client for your repository. From [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net), navigate to your project's overview page.  If you see a **Configure eclipse client** link on the right side of the page, you use [Jazz source control management](#jazzscm).  If you see a **Git URL** link on the right side of the page, you use a [Git Repository](#git)

<a name='git'></a>
## Git repositories
If you use a Git repository for your DevOps Services project, see [Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects and Git source control][1].
