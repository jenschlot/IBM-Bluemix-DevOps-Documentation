If you are building a Node.js application, you can use Bluemix™ Live Sync to quickly update the application instance on Bluemix and develop as you would on the desktop without redeploying. Bluemix Live Sync works from both the command line and in the web IDE. For an application written in Node.js or Java™, you can use Bluemix Live Sync to debug the application.
