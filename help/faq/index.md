### I see JazzHub is now called IBM&reg; DevOps Services. Can you tell me more? 

JazzHub has a new name. The JazzHub of today began life as an experimental development collaboration hub for 
academia and researchers, which was based on IBM&reg; Jazz&trade; technology. IBM learned a lot from that 
experience, and since then, IBM implemented JazzHub again in the cloud and opened it up to everyone.

IBM integrated the [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/ "Eclipse") Orion Web IDE and introduced the ability to deploy applications directly to the [IBM Bluemix&trade; cloud platform](https://bluemix.net/ "Bluemix"). IBM also 
plans to expand that capability to include continuous integration, unit testing, and deployment that is based 
on Jenkins and IBM UrbanCode. With these new capabilities and more to come, JazzHub builds on the core 
Jazz services to provide a good environment for cloud application development. 
To reflect the expanded role of JazzHub in the IBM family, IBM is renaming it "IBM DevOps Services." 
JazzHub continues to refer to the underlying technology stack as "Powered by JazzHub."

### Why does my sign in to DevOps Services fail from my Rational Team Concert&trade; desktop client or Git client? 

To sign in to DevOps Services from a web browser, you must first link an IBM id with a Jazz ID. 
After you link your IDs, you must use the combination of your Jazz ID and your IBM password to 
sign in to DevOps Services from your Rational Team Concert&trade; desktop client or to access a Git 
repository from your local Git client. This combination of Jazz ID and IBM password is required 
to support desktop-client users who created data with Jazz IDs.

This odd combination of Jazz ID and IBM id password is required to support the desktop-client users who created 
data with Jazz IDs. Desktop-client users include those who use Rational Team Concert clients for Eclipse and 
Visual Studio, as well as any local Git client. So, for now, new or existing desktop-client users 
must sign in with their Jazz ID and IBM id password when they connect to DevOps Services.

### Can I connect my project to a Github repository? 

Yes. When you create a project, select the option for Github and input your Github repository.

You can track and plan the work you'll store in your Github repository from within DevOps Services. To configure Github to update your work items when you push your changes, navigate to your project and click the **configure Github** link on the left side of the page.

You can also edit the code that is stored in your Github repository by using the web IDE. When you want to begin coding, navigate to your project and click **Edit Code** at the top of the page. Your Github repository will automatically be cloned for you, and your existing files will display in the navigation pane. You can create new files or edit existing ones. After you save changes to your files, select **Activities \> Git Status**. On this page, you can stage, commit, and push your changes.

### I'm work at IBM. What do I need to know about starting a DevOps Services project? 

In the spirit of open development, IBM encourages both public and private
projects and asks that you remember these guidelines:

- Never add IBM Confidential information to a DevOps Services project. 
- Before you get involved in projects that have open source code, consult the [Open Source Participation Guidelines](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W783ba5fa6c1a_40b3_945a_07d0eb0115bd).
- When you participate in projects on your own time, follow the [Business Conduct Guidelines](http://w3-03.ibm.com/ibm/documents/corpdocweb.nsf/ContentDocsByTitle/Business+Conduct+Guidelines), especially section 5.0 On Your Own Time. Talk it over with your manager, and involve your IBM legal contact
  as needed.
