## <tut> [Getting Started with BlueMix and DevOps Services using Node.js](/tutorials/jazzeditor)
See how easy it is to create a node.js web app at BlueMix and run that app. 
With one click you'll create a Git repo, 
load it with the example code and automatically deploy 
the app. You'll see how easy it will be to change 
the code and push it using the Git command line and the 
Web IDE, to check the status of the app deployment, and 
to run the app to show your changes.
