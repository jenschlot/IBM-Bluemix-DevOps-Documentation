## Tutorials

### [Getting Started with BlueMix and DevOps Services using Node.js](/tutorials/jazzeditor)
Tags: bluemix, devops,node.js

See how to create a node.js web app at BlueMix and run that app. 
With one click you'll create a Git repo, 
load it with the example code and automatically deploy 
the app. You'll see how easy it will be to change 
the code and push it using the Git command line and the 
Web IDE, to check the status of the app deployment, and 
to run the app to show your changes.


### [Getting Started with IBM Bluemix and IBM DevOps Services using Java](/tutorials/jazzeditorjava)
Tags: bluemix, devops, java

See how to create a Java web app at BlueMix and run that app. With a 
few clicks, you'll create a Git repo, load it with the example code, and automatically deploy
 the app. In minutes, you will make code changes and push them using the Git command line and 
 the Web IDE, automatically run a build and deploy, check the status of the app deployment, 
 and run the app to show your changes.

### [Build a sentiment analysis application with Node.js, Express, sentiment, and ntwitter](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-nodejs-app/)
Tags: devops, node.js, express,sentiment, ntwitter

See how to create an application to get immediate feedback from users, specifically online
 users. Getting an instant read on the Twitterverse's reactions to an app, product 
 launch, campaign, or current event, for example, would be enormously helpful. 
 Are the reactions positive, negative, neutral? With existing building blocks, you can put together, very quickly, a fun little sentiment analysis application.”
 This application is built as a PaaS app, using JavaScript and the popular Node.js 
runtime for PaaS apps. The app uses the service-composition programming model 
supported by PaaS environments like Cloud Foundry and Heroku developed at DevOps Services (formerly JazzHub). This provide
s me with a place to publish the application, as well as a nice browser-based IDE 
to develop the code.
