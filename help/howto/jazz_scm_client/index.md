**Before you begin**: Rational Team Concert 5.0 and later require Eclipse 4.3.2, and Eclipse requires Java 1.7.  
**Note**: If you do not have Eclipse installed and want tools for Java development, download and install the [Java EE IDE for Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2).  If you do not have Java 1.7 installed, download and install the [Java SE Development Kit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).

1. In Eclipse, click **Help > Install New Software**

3. In the Install window, complete the following steps:
 * In the **Work with** field, enter `https://jazz.net/downloads/rational-team-concert/5.0/5.0/p2`
 * Press Enter to load the contents of the update site.
 * Select the **Rational Team Concert Client Feature** check box.
 * Select the **Group items by category** check box
 * Click **Next** and click **Next** again.
 * Review the license terms and if you agree to the terms, accept them.
 * Click **Finish** to install the plug-in.

6. If you receive a security warning message, click **OK**.
