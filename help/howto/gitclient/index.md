#Working locally with IBM DevOps Services projects and Git source control

If you use a Git repository for your IBM&reg; DevOps Services project, you can manage your repository and work locally or by using the integrated Web IDE in DevOps Services. If you install Git, you can use the [command line to manage your repository](#command_line_git), or, if you work in [Eclipse](#eclipse_using_egit), you can install the EGit plug-in for version control. 

If you use the Track & Plan feature to manage your project plans and work items, you can access your project locally from Eclipse if you install the the Rational Team Concert plug-in.

## Access your repository by using command-line Git
---

If you're comfortable using the command line with Git, you can use this method to manage your repository.

### Clone your Git project from the command line
---

Before you access the contents of your repository outside the Web IDE, you make a local copy of the project files by cloning the Git repository. 

**Before you begin**: Check whether Git is already installed. At a command line, enter `git version`. If Git is installed, the version number is displayed and you can begin. If Git is not installed, download and install the version for your operating system from the [Git website](http://git-scm.com/downloads). You can accept the default installation values.

1. In [DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net/), navigate to your project page.

2. Copy the **Git URL** from the right side of the page.

3. Open a command line.

4. Change the directory to where you want the local copy of the Git repository.

5. Type `git clone`, paste the Git URL, and press Enter. When prompted, enter your Jazz ID and IBM id password.

After the download is complete, you have a local repository of the files for your project. For more information about using Git, see the [Git documentation](http://git-scm.com/doc).

## Access your repository by using Eclipse and the EGit plug-in
----

If you use Eclipse and you have a project that uses Git for source control, you can use the EGit plug-in to manage your repository from Eclipse.

If you do not have Eclipse installed and want tools for Java development, download and install the [Java EE IDE for Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/keplersr2) from eclipse.org.

**Before you begin**: Check whether the EGit plug-in is already installed. In Eclipse, click **Window > Show View > Other** and type `git` as the filter text. If you see a list of Git views, skip ahead to [Connect to your DevOps Services Project with EGit](#connect_to_your_devops_services_project_with_egit)
