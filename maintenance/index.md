# IBM DevOps Services Maintenance Schedule

As we continue to improve IBM DevOps Services, we will occasionally be required to do site maintenance during which time some or all of our services will be temporarily unavailable.

The duration of these outage windows is variable depending upon what needs to be done,  however for planning purposes the schedule below represents the maximum outage time expected during a given window.
