# Tell me about JazzHub projects 

So what's a JazzHub project.  Well, its really another name
for a repo. There are different repos that you can work with at JazzHub, but 
more about that later. Ok, so what can you do with a project. There are
many things you can do. Let's look at them. 

## Track and plan in context
Plans and code are smartly linked, 
so things stay in sync with development team progress.	 
It's easy to create stories, tasks, and defects to describe and track 
project work, and to use agile planning tools for the product backlog, 
releases, and sprints.

## See what people have been up to, and what's left to be done
Want to see how things are going, 
or who has too much or too little on their plate? 
The project dashboard is a great place to track progress and 
report on status. It's highly customizable – 
it's easy to add reports, graphs, and charts that best fit your project.

## Collaborate across the room or across the world and be part of something bigger
See which projects are trending. 
Get involved by joining someone else's project, 
or invite others in to help you with yours. 
Anyone you want can join your project – all you need is an email address.

## Code in the cloud
Easily edit any text file or script from within your browser. 
If your project contains JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby or PHP code, 
the JazzHub editor is likely all you need to make changes.

## Automatically deploy to the cloud
Configure your project to automatically deploy your app's to the IBM cloud 
platform, Codename BlueMix, 
whenever a member of your team pushes code to your Git repo hosted at 
JazzHub.

## Manage code with built-in source code management
Easy code delivery and seamless tracking of changes from 
all developers. 
Each project gets a Git repository or a Jazz source code management 
repository and workspace where project members check in changes, 
associate code changes with work items, and view a history of recent updates.

## Connect to your GitHub projects	
If you have existing source code in a GitHub repository, 
you can easily connect to your JazzHub project to track changes.

## Show off your work or not 
You decide if your project is public or private and who becomes a member. 
Public projects are visible to anyone while private projects 
are visible to people you invite – your eyes and trusted members only. 

To provide more access in either public or private projects, 
invite people to become members and accept requests from others to join. 
Project members can edit work items, plans, and code.

Right now public projects are free – so create as many as you like. 
Likewise, contribute to any project you're invited to, 
at no cost. We might introduce practical limits, such as on storage, 
as part of future JazzHub price plans. 

Private Projects are currently available at no charge. 
We intend to introduce a rate plan for Private Projects in 2014.
Don't worry, if you don't want to incur charges later, 
you can delete your private projects or make them public.
