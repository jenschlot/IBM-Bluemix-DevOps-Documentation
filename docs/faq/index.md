### I see JazzHub is now called IBM&reg; DevOps Services. Can you tell me more? 

JazzHub has a new name! JazzHub started as an experimental development collaboration hub for 
academia and researchers, and was based on IBM&reg; Jazz&trade; technology. The JazzHub team learned a lot from that 
experience. Since then, we implemented JazzHub again in the cloud and opened it up to everyone.

We integrated the Orion Web IDE from [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org/ "Eclipse").  We can now deploy applications directly to the [IBM Bluemix&trade; cloud platform](https://bluemix.net/ "Bluemix"). IBM  
plans to expand that capability to include continuous integration, unit testing, and deployment that is based 
on Jenkins and IBMÂ® UrbanCode. With these new capabilities and more to come, JazzHub builds on the core 
Jazz services to provide a great environment for cloud application development. 
To reflect the expanded role of JazzHub in the IBM family, we are renaming it "IBM DevOps Services." 
"JazzHub" will continue to refer to the underlying technology stack, as in "Powered by JazzHub."

### Why can't I sign in to DevOps Services from my Rational Team Concert&trade; desktop client or Git client? 

To sign in to DevOps Services from a web browser, you must first link an IBM id with a Jazz ID. After you link the IDs, you sign in to DevOps Services from a web browser by entering your IBM id and IBM password. However, to sign in from your Rational Team Concert desktop client or to access a Git repository from your local Git client, you enter your Jazz ID and your IBM password. This combination of Jazz ID and IBM password is a temporary solution: the goal is to move toward a single sign-on experience with an IBM id.

### Why can't I sign in to DevOps Services by using my Jazz ID anymore?

IBM DevOps Services, formerly known as JazzHub, initially required a Jazz ID 
to sign in. We are moving towards a single sign-on experience for all IBM services 
that requires only one IBM id. DevOps Services now requires Jazz users to link 
their Jazz IDs with their IBM ids. All web users must user their IBM ids to 
sign in.

### Can I connect my project to a GitHub repository? 

Yes. When you create a project, select the option for GitHub and enter your GitHub repository.

You can track and plan the work you'll store in your GitHub repository from DevOps Services. To configure GitHub to update your work items when you push your changes, navigate to your project and click the **configure GitHub** link on the left side of the page.

You can also edit the code that is stored in your GitHub repository by using the web IDE. When you want to start coding, navigate to your project and click **Edit Code** at the top of the page. Your GitHub repository is automatically cloned for you, and your files are shown in the navigation pane. You can create and edit files. After you save your changes, select **Activities \> Git Status**. On the page that opens, you can stage, commit, and push your changes.

### My team doesn't develop code. Is DevOps Services right for us?

### I'm an IBMer. What do I need to know about starting a DevOps Services project? 

In the spirit of open development, we encourage both public and private
projects and ask that you remember these guidelines:

- Never add IBM Confidential information to a DevOps Services project. 
- Before you get involved in projects that have open source code, [consult the Open Source Participation Guidelines](https://w3-connections.ibm.com/wikis/home?lang=en-us#!/wiki/W783ba5fa6c1a_40b3_945a_07d0eb0115bd).
- When you participate in projects on your own time, [follow the Business Conduct Guidelines](http://w3-03.ibm.com/ibm/documents/corpdocweb.nsf/ContentDocsByTitle/Business+Conduct+Guidelines). In particular, see section 5.0 On Your Own Time. Discuss it  with your manager, and involve IBM legal as needed.
