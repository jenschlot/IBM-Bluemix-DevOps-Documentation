### I see IBM DevOps Services is now called IBM Bluemix DevOps Services. Can you tell me more?

### Why can't I sign in to Bluemix DevOps Services from my Rational Team Concert desktop client or Git client? 

When you sign into Bluemix DevOps Services for the first time from a web browser, you must link your IBM id with an alias. (An alias is a publicly visible short name.) After your IBM id and alias are linked, use your IBM id and IBM password to sign in from a browser. When you sign in from your Rational Team Concert&trade; desktop client or access a Git repository from your local Git client, you use your alias and password instead. If you have an existing Jazz ID, that is used as your alias.

<a name="git"></a>

### Can I connect my project to a GitHub repository? 

Yes. When you create a project, select the option for GitHub and enter your GitHub repository.

You can track and plan the work you'll store in your GitHub repository from Bluemix DevOps Services. To configure GitHub to update your work items when you push your changes, navigate to your project and click the **configure GitHub** link on the left side of the page.

You can also edit the code that is stored in your GitHub repository by using the Web IDE. When you want to start coding, navigate to your project and click **Edit Code** at the top of the page. Your GitHub repository is automatically cloned for you, and your files are shown in the navigation pane. You can create and edit files. After you save your changes, select **Activities \> Git Status**. On the page that opens, you can stage, commit, and push your changes.

### Why can't I use the **Add Git** link from the Bluemix console?

For steps to resolve the issue, see [Cannot add Git repository](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#troubleshoot/index-gentopic4.html#cannot_addgit).
