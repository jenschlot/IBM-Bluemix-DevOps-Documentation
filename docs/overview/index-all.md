# What is IBM Bluemix DevOps Services

Last updated: 27 January 2015

IBM&reg; DevOps Services is software as a service (SaaS) on the cloud that supports continuous delivery. With DevOps Services, you can develop, track, plan, and deploy software in one place.
From your projects, you can access everything that you need to build all types of applications. To simplify team work, use the collaboration tools. After you build an application, you can deploy it to the IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; cloud platform. You can go from source code to a running application in minutes. 

IBM DevOps Services provides these capabilities:

* Agile planning, through the Track & Plan service

* A Web IDE for editing and managing source control

* Source control management (SCM), through Git, Jazz SCM, or GitHub

* Automated builds and deployments, through the Delivery Pipeline service

Bluemix is the platform where you deploy your application and can add services. The Bluemix catalog contains services for data management, mobile applications, cloud integration, web applications, and security.  The IBM DevOps services that are available from Bluemix are Delivery Pipeline and Track & Plan.  You can also source your Bluemix project in Git by using DevOps Services.

## What you can do with DevOps Services

Host an open source project. Run a hackathon. Start a skunkworks. Develop software for a cause or your company. Not coding? Plan anything, even the monthly meeting.  Check out what other people have done. (/docs/all#articles)

You decide whether your project is public or private and who can be a member. Public projects are visible to anyone. Private projects are visible to you and the people you invite. To allow more access in either public or private projects, invite people to become members and accept requests from others to join. Project members can edit work items, plans, and code.

## Why use DevOps Services

### Collaborate across the room or the world
Invite anyone to your project. All you need is an email address.

### Be part of the developer community
See which projects are trending. Get involved by joining someone else's project, or invite others in to help you with yours. Explore projects.

### Decide how you code
Code in the Web IDE, which is based on Eclipse Orion technology, or in the Rational Team Concert client for Eclipse or Visual Studio. Connect code to project plans and review in your browser.  Edit any text file or script from your browser. If your project contains JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby or PHP code, the Web IDE is likely all you need to make changes.

### Use your favorite client
Eclipse and .NET developers: Connect your projects to source code in Rational Team Concert client for Eclipse or Visual Studio.

### Connect to your GitHub repositories
If you have source code in a GitHub repository, connect to your DevOps Services project to track changes.

### Track and plan in context and see what's left to do

Plans and code are linked so that the development team's progress stays in sync. Create stories, tasks, and defects to describe and track project work, and use agile planning tools for the product backlog, releases, and sprints.  Set up your work and track your progress. Want to see how things are going, or who has too much or too little to do? Go to the project dashboard, which is the place to track progress and report on status. On the dashboard, you can add the reports, graphs, and charts that best fit your project

### Ditch the grunt work
We take care of the cloud so you can take care of the code. With no servers to install, configure, or maintain, you have more time and money to do what you enjoy.
