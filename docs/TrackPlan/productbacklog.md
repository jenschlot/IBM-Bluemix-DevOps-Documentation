# Create a product backlog

In Agile development, software features or technical debts are tracked as backlog.
You may have notice that there are four categories in the plan. They are

* Iteration backlog
* Release backlog
* Product backlog
* Cross-project Plan

The figure shows how these backlog are handled in the Agile development process.

A product backlog is an ordered features list, containing short descriptions 
of all functionality desired in the product.

The Product backlog is a single source of requirement for any changes to be made 
to the products. And this is living artifact (never complete).

Some characteristics are:

* Typically lists features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that are desired in the product. Technical work and knowledge acquisition 
also belong in the product backlog

* Product Backlog items can be of varying size, effort or complexity

* Backlog items selected for the upcoming Sprint are fine-grained and so that any one item can be done within the Sprint time-box

* Multiple Scrum teams often work on the same Product Backlog; an attribute is used to group items


In this section. You will create product backlog for the project using 
JazzHub planning capability.

## Manage Product backlog

Product backlog is created by JazzHub project creation by default. To open the backlog,
follow the steps below.

1. Click "TRACK&PLAN" icon.
> ![Click TRACK&PLAN](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.trackplanbutton.png)

2. Select "Plans" -> "All Plans" menu
> ![Click TRACK&PLAN](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.allplanmenu.png)

3. Click "Product Backlog"
> ![Click TRACK&PLAN](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.selectproductbacklog.png)


As you may notice, the plan editor is probably empty. For ease of use of
this tutorial. Check "Auto-Save" checkbox botton. This will enable to
auto-save when you edit the plan.

## Create product backlog

To create product backlog, you will create so called "work item". There are several work item 
types such as Epic, Story, Task, Defect, so on. For the product backlog, story or epic work 
item type is probably sufficient. To add work items, follow the steps below.

1. Click "Add Work Item" button. For this tutorial, select "Story".
> ![Create Story](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.createstory.png)

2. Add summary for this work item.
> ![Add Summary](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.setstorysummary.png)

3. Add more work items.
> ![Add more stories](../images/trackplan/productbacklog.addmorestories.png)

Now, you have several product backlogs. Go back to project top page, and select 
"CURRENT WORK". You will notice that the work items created are displayed in the
project top pages now.
