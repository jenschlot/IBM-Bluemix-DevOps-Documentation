# Push changes for the IBM DevOps Services Sentiment analysis app
You've started your IBM DevOps Services app work by changing the sentiment analysis app and then forking that app to your
own IBM DevOps Services project.  You want to share your changes with other users of the project 
so let's push them from your local repo to the remote repo. 
First you go to the Git Status page in the code editor and stage the app.js file.

Next, you click **COMMIT**, enter a commit message and click **Submit**. 
This backs up your changes to your local repository.

Clicking **PUSH** pushes the changes to the remote project repo.

But wait, how do you get your changes automatically deployed to BlueMix. You can use the IBM DevOps Services
auto-deployment feature. Try it at [Turn on auto-deployment for the Sentiment Analysis app](turnonautodeploy).
