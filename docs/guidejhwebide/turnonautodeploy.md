# Turn on auto-deployment for the Sentiment Analysis app
So far you have pushed changes to your remote repo but you want to trigger a deployment automatically every time code gets pushed there. 
To set that up, you turn on auto-deployment. You do this by going to the AUTO-DEPLOYMENT tab on the project page 
and clicking the **ON** button. Clicking the **REFRESH** button shows you the status of your deployment in the Recent Auto-Deployments section. 
Upon successful deployment, a link to the deployed application is displayed beside the **Deploy to application** field on the page.
