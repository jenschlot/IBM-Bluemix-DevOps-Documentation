1. [Create an app from a NodeJS Web Starter Boilerplate](../guidebm/starterapp)
2. [Create a JazzHub project to contain the starter app](../guidebm/addcodetojh)
3. [Deploy automatically the starter app to BlueMix](../guidebm/checkjhauto)
4. [Edit code by using the Git command line](../guidebm/editgitcmdline)
5. [Edit code with the JazzHub Web IDE](../guidebm/editjheditor)
6. [Push changes by using the JazzHub Web IDE](../guidebm/pushchgfromjh)

So that's all there is to it. In a few steps you created a new app from a BlueMix starter app, loaded it 
in to a Git repo hosted at JazzHub, then changed and pushed the code with the Git command line and
JazzHub Web IDE. With auto-deployment on you saw your app changes automatically deployed to BlueMix.
