# Start a project in IBM DevOps Bluemix Services 

Last modified: 8 January 2015

You can start an IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project in three ways. If you want to start by using new code or an existing Git repository, 

with all new code or use an existing Git repository, [create a project](#starting_a_devops_services_project). If you want to start from a copy of the code in a Bluemix DevOps Services project, [fork the code](#forking_a_devops_services_project).  You can also [create a Bluemix DevOps Services project from an IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; app](#creating_a_devops_services_project_for_your_bluemix_app).

**Before you begin**
* [Register for Bluemix DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). 
* If you plan to deploy your project to IBM Bluemix, which is a cloud-based software hosting and deployment service, [register for Bluemix](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/).

##Creating a project

1. Sign in to [Bluemix DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). The My Stuff page opens.

2. If this project is your first project, click the **Start coding** icon. Otherwise, click **CREATE PROJECT**.

3. Type the project name.

4. Select a repository type.  
 * If you are familiar with IBM&reg;  Rational Team Concert&trade; and want to use Jazz&trade; source control management (SCM), click the **Use Jazz SCM** icon.
 * If you are familiar with Git and want to create a hosted repository, click the **Create a Git repository** icon.  
**Tip**: You can host a local Git repository on Bluemix DevOps Services. First, create the new Bluemix DevOps Services project; then, force push the local repository to the new hosted repository.
 * If you stored code in a GitHub repository, you can continue to use that repository. Click the **Connect to an external GitHub repository** icon and paste the repository URL into the field.

5. If you want to control who can view your project and its code, select the **Private** check box. Bluemix DevOps Services users who you invite can access your private projects. 

6. If you want to use all of the Track & Plan features, including the ability to create sprints from the project backlog of work items, select the **Add features for Scrum development** check box.  
If you want to use only the traditional planning feature, which uses simplte tasks and iterations without a backlog, clear the check box.

7. To deploy the project code to Bluemix, select the **Deploy to Bluemix** check box.  
**Important**: Building and deploying apps can result in charges to your Bluemix billing account. For more information about pricing, [see the Bluemix pricing page](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/pricing).
