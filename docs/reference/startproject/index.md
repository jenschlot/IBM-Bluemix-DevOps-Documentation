# Start a project in Bluemix DevOps Services 

Last modified: 5 May 2015

You can start an IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project in three ways. If you want to start by using new code or an existing Git repository, [create a project](#starting_a_devops_services_project). If you want to start from a copy of the code in a Bluemix DevOps Services project, [fork the code](#forking_a_devops_services_project).  You can also [create a Bluemix DevOps Services project from an IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; app](#creating_a_devops_services_project_for_your_bluemix_app).

**Before you begin**
* [Register for Bluemix DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). 
* If you plan to deploy your project to IBM Bluemix, which is a cloud-based software hosting and deployment service, [register for Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/).

##Creating a project

1. Sign in to [IBM Bluemix DevOps Services](https://hub.jazz.net). The MY PROJECTS page opens.

2. If this project is your first project, click on **Start coding**. Otherwise, click **CREATE PROJECT**.

3. Type the project name.

4. Select a repository type. 
  * If you are familiar with GitHub, you can create a new GitHub repository. Click the **Create a new repository** icon, and then click the **Create a Git repo on GitHub** icon. If you stored code in a GitHub repository, you can also continue to use that repository. Click the **Link to an existing repository** icon, and then select the repository from the list.    
**Tip**: You can add supporting files to your repository, like a readme, a Git ignore file, or a license file. Select the readme check box or choose from the list of ignore files and licenses.
 * If you are familiar with Git and want to create a hosted repository, click the **Create a new repository** icon, and then click the **Create a Git repo on Bluemix** icon.  
**Tip**: You can host a local Git repository on Bluemix DevOps Services. First, create the new Bluemix DevOps Services project; then, force push the local repository to the new hosted repository.
 * If you are familiar with IBM&reg;  Rational Team Concert&trade; and want to use Jazz&trade; source control management (SCM), click the **Create a new repository** icon, and then click the **Create Jazz SCM on Bluemix** icon.
 
5. If you want to control who can view your project and its code, select the **Private** check box. Bluemix DevOps Services users who you invite can access your private projects.    
**Note**: To create a private repository on GitHub, you must have a paid GitHub account. If necessary, click **Change your GitHub plan or use a private Bluemix repository instead.

6. If you want to use all of the Track & Plan features, including the ability to create sprints from the project backlog of work items, select the **Add features for Scrum development** check box.  
If you want to use only the traditional planning feature, which uses simplte tasks and iterations without a backlog, clear the check box.

7. To deploy the project code to Bluemix, select the **Make this a Bluemix Project** check box.  
**Important**: Building and deploying apps can result in charges to your Bluemix billing account. For more information about pricing, [see the Bluemix Pricing page](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/?ace_base=true/#/pricing).

8. Click **CREATE**.
