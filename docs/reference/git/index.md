#Git reference

Last modified: 14 January 2015

If you store your code in a Git repository that is hosted by IBMÂ® DevOps Services, you can work with code in a Git terminal or in a web integrated development environment (IDE). If you work on a local workstation, you can use Git terminal commands to edit the contents of your hosted repository. If you use the web IDE, you don't need the Git terminal: you can run many common Git commands in the web IDE.  

To access Git commands from the web IDE, click the Git Repository icon <img src="./images/gitrepository.png"  align="bottom" style="display: inline; margin: 0px; border-style: none; margin-bottom: 0px;">.

No matter where you code, you can use this quick reference to do common tasks.

### Set up a local Git repository

#### DevOps Services web IDE
When you use a hosted Git repository with your DevOps Services project, you work with both your local and remote repositories through the web IDE.

1. Click **EDIT CODE** <img src="./images/editcode.gif"  align="bottom" style="display: inline; margin: 0px; border-style: none; margin-bottom: 0px;"> and start coding!

#### Git terminal
If you want to code and test locally, set up a local repository.

**Before you begin**: If Git is not installed on your computer, [follow these instructions][1].

1. Determine which directory to store your local repository in. If necessary, you can create a directory.

1. By using your terminal, move to the directory.  

1. [Go to DevOps Services][2]. On the My Stuff page, click your project's name.

1. From your project's Overview page, click **Git URL** and copy the URL.

1. In your terminal, type `git clone `, paste your Git URL, and press Enter.

1. When you are prompted, enter your IBM id and password.  
**Note**: If you are not prompted for your password, do not continue.  Delete your cloned repository
and repeat the steps by using a modified repository address: `https://your_jazz_id:your_IBM_ID_password@hub.jazz.net/jazz_id/project_name`.

1. After your repository replicates, move into your new local repository.
