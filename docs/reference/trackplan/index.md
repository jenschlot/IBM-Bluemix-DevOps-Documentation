##Managing work items


###Work item states:
- Open: Items that are not started
- In progress: Items that are started
- Resolved: Items that are finished

###Work item display options
- List display: Work items by type and includes lots of detail
- Table display: Work items in a condensed format
- Lane display: Work items grouped by state. Two states are visible at one time. Scroll horizontally to display the third state.

###Creating work items
Where you create the work item affects its settings. If you create a work item in the **My work** view, the work item is automatically owned by you. Set attributes when you create a work item by clicking the icons. You can also click the summary of a work item to open and edit work item attributes.

###Searching for a work item

###Filtering work items
In the **My work**, **My subscribed**, **Incoming work**, **Backlog**, **Sprint planning**, **Team's work**, and **All work** views, you can filter work items based on key words or on values for specific attribute types. If you type in a keyword, the work item summaries that contain that keyword will display. To filter work items based on values for specific attributes, refer to the following table.

| Variable |Example | 
|-------|-------|
|*Type  | *Defect |
|#Tag  | #conference| 
|@:Owner  | @:jasmith|
|^Category|^Development team|
|$Priority|$High|
|!Severity|!Major|

###Managing work items for the project

####Triaging work items
Check the **Incoming work** view to see new work items that team members or guests create. Work items display in the Incoming work view when they are not assigned to a sprint. As soon as they are assigned to a sprint, they no longer display in the Incoming work view.

Options for triaging work items in the Incoming work view:
- Click the **Trash this item** icon to reject the work item. The work items is resolved and the status is changed to **Invalid**.
- Click the **Triage to backlog** icon to accept the work item and assign it to the backlog. Then the work item can be evaluated against other work items in the **Sprint planning** view and assigned to a specific sprint.
- Open the work item and assign it to a specific sprint.

####Planning work for the team
In the **Sprint planning** view, you can plan sprints by dragging ranked work items between sprints. Drag work items between lanes to reassign them. 

Tip: Click the pin icon to keep a lane open. If you pin open the backlog, you can move work items easily from the backlog to a specific sprint.

You can also review statistics about the sprint's progress.

Available statistics:
- Hours worked vs. total hours estimated
- Work items completed vs. total work items
- Story points acheived vs. total story points estimated

#####Ranking work items
Review the work items in the **Backlog** and Sprint Planning views to rank work items while planning a sprint
- Assign story points to work items
- Drag work items into position to assign them a rank

####Reviewing the team's progress
In the **Team's work** view, review all of the work items assigned to the team and statistics for the team's progress.

Available statistics:
- Hours worked vs. total hours estimated
- Work items completed vs. total work items
- Story points acheived vs. total story points estimated

You can also use the **All work** view to review all of the work items by state.
