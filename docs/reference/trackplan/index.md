###Managing work items for the project


####Triaging work items
Check the **Incoming work** view to see new work items that team members or guests create. Work items display in the Incoming work view when they are not assigned to a sprint. As soon as they are assigned to a sprint, they no longer display in the Incoming work view.

Options for triaging work items in the Incoming work view:
- Click the **Trash this item** icon to reject the work item. The work items is resolved and the status is changed to **Invalid**.
- Click the **Triage to backlog** icon to accept the work item and assign it to the backlog. Then the work item can be evaluated against other work items in the **Sprint planning** view and assigned to a specific sprint.
- Open the work item and assign it to a specific sprint.
