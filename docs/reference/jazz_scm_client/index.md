# Setting up local Eclipse clients to work with Jazz source control

Last modified: 20 March 2015

If you use Jazz Source Control Management (SCM) for your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services project, you can either work locally and deliver changes through Eclipse or work by using the integrated Web IDE. If you work locally and deliver changes through Eclipse, you can install the IBM&reg; Rational Team Concert&trade; plug-in for version control.

If you use the Track & Plan feature to manage your project plans and work items, you can also access your work items from Eclipse.
