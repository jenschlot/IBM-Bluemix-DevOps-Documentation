#Configure Bluemix billing for Bluemix DevOps Services

Last modified: 31 March 2015

All IBM&reg;  Bluemix&trade; DevOps Services projects include an allowance of free services. If you exceed your allowances, your work is interrupted. To avoid interruptions, set up a Bluemix billing account and configure your services. By configuring your Bluemix account, you also get advanced features for monitoring your builds, deployments, and status of your projects. 

If you plan to use the Delivery Pipeline (Build & Deploy) and Track & Plan services beyond the free allowance, configure both services. Each service requires a separate billing configuration.

##Set up a billing account

Before you set up your billing account, determine what the best plan for your project is. [Learn more about billing accounts](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#acctmgmt/billing.html#bil_plan).

**Important:** The person who is responsible for setting up the billing account might not be the same person who is most affected by build and deployment failures and blocked access to Track & Plan pages. If you are not the person who sets up the account, ask your Bluemix billing manager to enable your billing account early.

To set up your billing account, complete these steps: 
1. Go to your Bluemix dashboard and select the space that is listed in your DevOps Services project settings. 
2. Click **Services** and click **Add a Service or API**.
3. From the DevOps section, select either **Delivery Pipeline** or **Track & Plan**.
4. In the "Add Service" section, make sure that the space that corresponds to your  DevOps Services project is selected.
5. From the **Selected Plan** list, choose a billing plan. 
6. Click **Create.**

##Monitor your usage


You can monitor the usage details for your Bluemix account. For more information, [see the billing and usage documentation](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#acctmgmt/index-gentopic1.html#genTopProcId2). To determine costs, [see the Bluemix Pricing page](https://bluemix.net/#/pricing).

The Delivery Pipeline and Track & Plan services use metered pricing, where you pay based on consumption. However, they also include a free monthly allowance.

To help monitor monthly usage, [see the Bluemix cost estimator](https://ace.ng.bluemix.net/#/pricing/paneId=pricingSheet).
