# Share code changes from Eclipse
You can update your application that is in a Git repo hosted at JazzHub and then push those changes so that your teammates have them. 
The following instructions explain how to complete those tasks from Eclipse.

This procedure is more effective if you complete it with a partner, so the steps are divided between Partner A and Partner B.

# Share code changes from the JazzHub Web IDE 

You can update your application that is a Git repo hosted at JazzHub, push your changes to IBM BlueMix, and then deliver those changes so that your teammates have them. The following instructions explain how to complete those tasks from the Web IDE.

This section introduces you to Git source control in JazzHub. For information about source control command shortcuts, see the Jazz.net blog post about What's the difference between Ignore, Undo, Deliver, Suspend, Discard, and Reverse.

This procedure is more effective if you complete it with a partner, so the steps are divided between Partner A and Partner B. To add a teammember for this procedure, execute the steps in the Invite others to join your project section of this tutorial.

## Make a change and push it from the Web IDE

Partner A pushes changes to the repository by completing these steps.

If you are not currently in the JazzHub code editor, browse for your project on hub.jazz.net, open your project, and then click Edit Code for your project.
    Open a file in your sample application code base and make a change to it that you can test when you deploy the application. For example, if you are using the Sentiment Analysis App code base, you have already made changes to manifest.yml and package.json while configuring your forked application.
    In the Unstaged section, click the Stage icon.

    Your change is shown in the Staged section. Changes in this section are checked into your repository workspace and are backed up on the server; however, they are not delivered to the project stream for others on your team. Click COMMIT to commit the changes.

    Screenshot: Commit
    In the commit message window, enter a comment to describe your changes and click SUBMIT.

    Screenshot: Submit
    Your change is shown in the Commits for "master" branch section. Changes in this section are checked into your repository workspace and are backed up on the server; however, they are not delivered to the project stream for others on your team.
    In the Commits for "master" branch section, click PUSH to push changes to the project stream for your teammates.
