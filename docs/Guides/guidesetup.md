# Setting up Eclipse, Git, and RTC Desktop Clients for use with JazzHub 
JazzHub lets you decide how you code. Want to get started right away? This guide helps you set up the client 
that's best for you.

How about trying our JazzHub editor, which is based on Eclipse Orion technology. 
You can edit any text file or script from within your browser. That's easy! 
If your project contains JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Ruby or PHP code, the JazzHub editor 
is likely all you need to make changes. 

You're an Eclipse or .NET developer and already have a favorite client? 
We'll show you how to configure your client and connect to your JazzHub project from within the Rational Team Concert 
client for Eclipse or Visual Studio. Skip to [Coding with Eclipse plug-ins](../Setup/eclipseclient). 
More details about [Coding with Visual Studio](../Setup/visualstudio) are coming soon.

Prefer to use your trusty command line tool? 
Go right ahead to [Connecting with the command line](../Setup/commandline).
