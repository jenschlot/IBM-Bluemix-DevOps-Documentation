# Share code changes from Eclipse
You can update your application and then push those changes so that your teammates have them. 
The following instructions explain how to complete those tasks from Eclipse when you have your source
code in a Git repo hosted at IBM DevOps Services.

This procedure is more effective if you complete it with a partner, so the steps are divided between Partner A and Partner B.

## Make a change and check it in from Eclipse
