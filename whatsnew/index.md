## What's New

### December 10, 2014

In the last few months, we have seen a tremendous amount of positive feedback for the IBM&reg; DevOps Services Track & Plan Beta. Our first priority is to provide you the ability the track your work, monitor your team's activity, and plan your sprints without the tool getting in your way. 

In that spirit, we are pleased to announce that the new Track & Plan feature is now generally available for all DevOps Services projects.

Here is an overview of the changes in Track & Plan:
* Clicking on the **Track & Plan** button will always take you to the new Track & Plan. You don't have to explicitly enable the new Track & Plan anymore.
* The previous version of Track & Plan is still available for a limited period of time. To use the previous version of Track & Plan, click the down arrow on to the **Track & Plan** button and selectÂ **Project Dashboard**.
* The Current Work functionality will be retired in favor of the new Track & Plan. Clicking on the **Current Work** tab, or using a bookmark for Current Work, will always take you to the new Track & Plan.

This is a significant milestone for us and we hope you continue to give us feedback.

Here are the details of what's new in Track & Plan:

## Ranking improvements
You can drag and drop items from the **Recently Created** view to the **Ranked List** view to rank them. The rank of the item is now also displayed in the **Sprint Planning** view.
![dragging work item to rank][68]

Additionally, you can click the rank number to edit it instead of dragging and dropping.
![editing rank number][69]

## Work item count
The work item count is now displayed on each view. For views with paged results, the count includes the work items that are not loaded yet. The count is updated as work items are added or removed from the view. Filtering a view also updates the work item count.
![count examples on My Work lanes and backlog][70] 

## Shortcut to set 'planned for' attribute
When you use the Quick Create feature to create a work item, you can now set the planned for attribute by entering "~" as a keyboard shortcut.
![Planned for attribute shortcut][71]

## Grid view is now table view
The new table view displays more work items and additional columns in a more condensed form than the grid view. The table view makes it easier to find information in a long list of work items. 
![New table view][72]

## Sprint Planning
The start and end dates of the sprint now show in the title of each lane in the **Sprint Planning** view.
![Dates in Sprint Planning view][73]

## Task breakdown action now available everywhere
Previously, you could only access the task breakdown action from the **Backlog** or **Sprint Planning** views. Now, you can access the task breakdown action from all views. When you are assigned a story, for example, you can break it down to tasks without ever leaving the **My Work** view.
![task breakdown in My Work view][74]


### November 10, 2014

The IBM DevOps Services web integrated development environment (IDE) has been significantly changed. It has several new user interfaces (UI) and more capabilities.

## Git UI

On the Git UI, you can now access all major Git capabilities in a layout that is like the web IDE editor. On one page, you can view history, sync changes, create commits, and more. For complete details about the updates, see the announcement on the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/announcing-orion-7-0/).

![Image of new Git UI showing commits](images/gitcommit.png)

##Help system

The help system is now a simple HTML5 and JavaScript page with overview and detail panes.

![Image of new web IDE help system](images/newidehelp.png)

##A new global search UI

Instead of needing to open the global search page, you can now search directly from the editor. To run a global search, click **Edit -> Global Search**.

![Image of new web IDE search](images/newidesearch.png)

##Third-party libraries

 * [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) was updated to 0.7.2
 * [Doctrine](https://github.com/Constellation/doctrine) was updated to 0.5.1
 * [CSSLint](https://github.com/CSSLint/csslint) was updated to 0.10.0


##Language tooling

The CSS and JavaScript language tooling is improved in this release.

###Content assist

By using the JavaScript content assist, you can now place proposals inside JSDoc-formatted comments and obtain assistance while adding JSDoc tags and working with parameters, type objects, and RegExp literals. For full details, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

###ESLint support

The web IDE has new linting rules and a few content assist templates and completions that you can use to create ESLint directives.

 * You can detect empty code blocks by using the new no-empty-block rule, which is off by default.
 * The new throw-error rule, ensures that you throw error-objects only from throw statements. 
 * The web IDE no longer uses JSLint or JSHint directives. Instead, warnings are shown when unsupported usage is detected based on a linting rule. 
 * To correct ESLint directives, you can use the new content assist completions.
 * You can use the new ESLint directive templates.
 * You can find assistance to set up an environment and to disable or enable rules.

For full details, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

###Parser improvements

To provide content assist inside JSDoc blocks, the web IDE now recovers unclosed or incomplete comment blocks while parsing your source. The new block comment recovery support parses and recovers all complete statements up to the incomplete comment.

The web IDE also reports parsing errors that cause a complete failure to parse, where no tokens at all are being returned from the parse. For full details, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

###Improved mark occurrences

The web IDE is more accurate and provides more occurrence support.

 * You can show occurrences of labeled statements, throw statements, and things that were not defined in the file.
 * You can mark occurrences in use-before-define and hoisting scenarios. 

For full details, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

##Editor hover help

In the web IDE, if you hover over a function, the rendered documentation for that function is shown. To view an example, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

##Cloud foundry tooling

The web IDE now has a Cloud Foundry manifest editor that highlights syntax, reports on errors and warnings, and provides content assist. In addition, from the deploy window you can launch applications that have missing or incomplete manifests, and persist missing manifest content during deployment. For more details, see the [Orion website](http://planetorion.org/news/2014/10/orion-7-0-language-tooling-enhancements/).

## Build and Deploy to IBM Bluemix

###Multistage deployment

You can now configure IBM DevOps Services projects to deploy to multiple Bluemix spaces. To use multistage deployment, create more than one deployer stage. For example, you might configure a stage that deploys to a "dev" space for development, and another that deploys to a "production" space. 

![a configured pipeline set-up][55]

### Automatic builds can now be disabled

When you use the Advanced Build & Deploy option, you can disable automatic builds that run when changes are pushed to your project. To disable the automatic builds, clear the **Automatically build when a change is delivered/pushed** check box when you configure a builder.

you will need to configure these Add-Ons in Bluemix. 
Learn more about [Bluemix pricing](https://hub.jazz.net/learn/cost). 

## Web IDE enhancements

### From Many to One

You can now work with Git from a single page. The current Git page looks like this (with sections collapsed):


>	![Git repository page](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo.png)


Let's take a look at what's in each of these sections. 

### Repo Header

At the very top of the page, there is name of the repo along with buttons that perform repo-level actions:

* **Apply Patch** shows a dialog so you can select the URL or file that contains the patch
* **Pull** performs a pull on the repo (fetch + rebase)
* **Delete** deletes this repo


### Changed Files

This section replaces the Git Status page. Changed Files shows you the current state of your working directory. With no files changed, the section looks like this:

.	![Git repo changed files](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-changed-files.png)

The top of the section contains 2 buttons:

* **Discard** discards any changes made to selected files and reverts the files to their previous committed state.
* **Commit** commits the selected files with the messaged entered in the commit message box.

Next is the commit message box where you type your commit message. Notice the 2 checkboxes. **Amend Previous Commit** toggles to amend the previous commit (the previous message is fetched and displayed in the message box). **Prepare for Gerrit** adds a `ChangeId` to the commit message.

When files are changed, they show in a table under the commit message box:

>	![Git repo changed file selection](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-changed-file-selection.png)

You can expand the files to reveal the changes made:

>	![Git repo changes revealed](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-changes-revealed.png)

You can also view the differences side by side or open a compare editor to view the differences.

You can select the files to include in the commit by using the checkboxes (or the select all checkbox if you want to include all files). As you select files, a number counter at the top of the table changes to match your selected file count.

Once you have selected your files (and typed in a commit message) you can click **Commit** to commit them (or **Discard** to discard the changes made).

When you have files selected, a Show Patch link showns on the same line with the Commit and Discard buttons. This creates a patch for you out of the files that you have selected.


>	![Git repo commit](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-commit.png)

###Commits

The commits section has new sub-sections.

>	![Git repo commits section](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-commits-section.png)

* **Outgoing** lists all of the commits that were not pushed to the remote repo

* **Incoming** lists all of the commits that were not merged into the local repo

* **History** lists all of the commits that the local branch has in common with the remote branch

Let's see what happens, when a change is committed:

>	![Git repo commit changed file](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-commit-changed-file.png)


The commit shows in the **Outgoing** section. There is a new **Undo** button so you can undo the commit and restore changed files back into your working directory (a soft reset).

Before pushing, you want to be sure that you are caught up to all changes, so you can click **Fetch** in the **Incoming** section to fetch the latest changes. All of the changes that were not merged show and you can accept them by clicking **Rebase** or **Merge**.

>	![Git repo commit fetch](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-commit-fetch.png)


The accepted changes now show up in the **History** section. If you have lots of entries you can scroll down to view the the history, or click **More commits for <Branch>** to load more entries.

Once you are all up to date with the remote branch, you can push your changes.

There is also a new button **Sync**, which is a combination of Fetch, Rebase and Push functions.

### Changes in a Commit

Expanding any commit in the history shows the changed files (this is true for any place a commit is shown on the page):

>	![Git repo commit history](/whatsnew/images/orion-repo-commit-history.png)


### Branches and Tags

The branches and tags sections were merged into one section as well. There are top level items for local branches, remotes and tags. The 2 buttons in this section are:

* **New Remote** which opens a dialog to add a new remote
* **New Branch** which opens a dialog to create a new branch

>	![Git repo branches and tags](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-branches-tags.png)

If you expand the local item, you can see all of the local branches that you have for the current repo. You can check a branch out from here.

>	![Git repo checkout branch](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-checkout-branch.png)

If you expand the branch, you can see the log for that branch along with all the allowable actions next to each commit.

>	![Git repo expand branch](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-expand-branch.png)

Each remote can be expanded to show all of its remote branches along with applicable actions for each entry.

You can see the log for a remote branch by expanding it.

The tags section follows the same pattern. When you expand the top level item, you are presented with the list of tags along with all the available actions for that tag.

 
### Configuration

The configuration section is now shown as a table.


>	![Git repo configuration section](/whatsnew/images/orion-git-repo-config-section.png)

## Build and Deploy to IBM Bluemix

### Simple application deployment to IBM Bluemix for Jazz SCM projects

You can now set up Simple auto-deployment of your IBM&reg; Bluemix&trade; application for
a Jazz&trade; SCM project. 
If you selected the **Deploy to Bluemix** option when 
you created your Jazz SCM project, or choose this option in Project Settings,
you can select the Simple option under Build & Deploy.
When Simple is turned on, any changes delivered to the configured
Jazz SCM stream triggers a push 
of the application to Bluemix.

## General enhancements

### More options when forking a project

When you fork a project from the Web IDE, you can now select if your project is public or private, if
you would like to add features for Scrum
development, and if you would like to deploy your application to Bluemix. The options to make it private 
and deploy to Bluemix can be changed in Project Settings after your project is created.
