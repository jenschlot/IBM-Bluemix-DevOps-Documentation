# The manifest file

Deploying a DevOps Services project from the Web IDE requires the project to have a `manifest.yml` file. This file contains important settings such as the application instance name to use, the host machine, the services that the application uses, and more. The sample application already contains a manifest, so you can leave it alone in this tutorial.
